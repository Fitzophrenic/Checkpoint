# Checkpoint
Checkpoint is a documentation and organization tool made for game developers who are tired of scattered notes, playtests, and project files.
It centralizes to-do lists, development logs, and documentation into a single, customizable desktop app. Built with JavaFX for flexibility and SQLite for lightweight data storage, Checkpoint helps game teams focus on what matters: Creating the games.
